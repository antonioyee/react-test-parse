### Getting up and running

1. Clone this repo from `https://github.com/jakemmarsh/react-rocket-boilerplate.git`
2. Run `npm install` from the root directory
3. Run `gulp dev` (may require installing Gulp globally `npm install gulp -g`)
4. Your browser will automatically be opened and directed to the browser-sync proxy address
5. To prepare assets for production, run the `gulp prod` task (Note: the production task does not fire up the express server, and won't provide you with browser-sync's live reloading. Simply use `gulp dev` during development. More information below)
